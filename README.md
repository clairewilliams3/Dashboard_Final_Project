This dashboard:

- Introduces late-life depression
- Uses replicated data inspired by confidential data from the REMBRANDT study
- Examines the relationship between late-life depression recurrence and time sedentary using wearable technology data

This project further integrates wearable technology into mental health research and emphasizes the relationship between inactivity and late-life depression.  The visualizations inspire further research on late-life depression and promote physical activity as a potential preventative measure.
